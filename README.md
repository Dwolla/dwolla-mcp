## üè¶ About Dwolla & This MCP Server

This MCP server enables AI agents to **retrieve and analyze** data from Dwolla's payment platform using natural language. It provides read-only access to Dwolla's comprehensive payment infrastructure, allowing you to inspect accounts, analyze transfer history, monitor customer data, and generate insights from your payment operations.

### üí° What You Can Do

- **Account Monitoring** - View account details, balances, and funding sources
- **Customer Analytics** - Analyze customer data, beneficial ownership, and compliance status  
- **Transfer Analysis** - Examine transfer history, status, and failure reasons
- **Mass Payment Insights** - Review bulk payment operations and their items
- **Compliance Reporting** - Access documents, KBA sessions, and verification data
- **Business Intelligence** - Query exchange data, webhooks, and system events

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Scope

> **Read-Only Operations**: This MCP server currently supports **data retrieval and analysis only**. It does not support creating customers, initiating transfers, or modifying account data at the moment. This makes it ideal for reporting, analytics, and monitoring workflows while maintaining security for sensitive payment operations.

### üåç Environment Support

- **Sandbox Environment** (`https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com`) - Perfect for development and testing
- **Production Environment** (`https://api.dwolla.com`) - Live payment data access

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token_here" \
     https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com/

# Should return API root information
```

### üìä Debugging Tips

**Verbose Logging**
- Check your MCP client's logs for detailed error messages
- Enable debug mode in your client if available
- Monitor network requests to identify API call failures

**Test with MCP Inspector**

  ```bash
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx -y --package @dwolla/mcp-server -- mcp start --bearer-auth "your_token" --server-url https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com
  ```

### üí° Performance Optimization
