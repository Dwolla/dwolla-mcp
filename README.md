## üè¶ About Dwolla & This MCP Server

This MCP server enables AI agents to **retrieve and analyze** data from Dwolla's payment platform using natural language. It provides read-only access to Dwolla's comprehensive payment infrastructure, allowing you to inspect accounts, analyze transfer history, monitor customer data, and generate insights from your payment operations.

### üí° What You Can Do

- **Account Monitoring** - View account details, balances, and funding sources
- **Customer Analytics** - Analyze customer data, beneficial ownership, and compliance status  
- **Transfer Analysis** - Examine transfer history, status, and failure reasons
- **Mass Payment Insights** - Review bulk payment operations and their items
- **Compliance Reporting** - Access documents, KBA sessions, and verification data
- **Business Intelligence** - Query exchange data, webhooks, and system events

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Scope

> **Read-Only Operations**: This MCP server currently supports **data retrieval and analysis only**. It does not support creating customers, initiating transfers, or modifying account data at the moment. This makes it ideal for reporting, analytics, and monitoring workflows while maintaining security for sensitive payment operations.

### üåç Environment Support

- **Sandbox Environment** (`https://api-sandbox.dwolla.com`) - Perfect for development and testing
- **Production Environment** (`https://api.dwolla.com`) - Live payment data access

## Installation

<details>
<summary>DXT (Desktop Extension)</summary>

Install the MCP server as a Desktop Extension using the pre-built [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file:

Simply drag and drop the [`mcp-server.dxt`](./mcp-server.dxt) file onto Claude Desktop to install the extension.

The DXT package includes the MCP server and all necessary configuration. Once installed, the server will be available without additional setup.

> [!NOTE]
> DXT (Desktop Extensions) provide a streamlined way to package and distribute MCP servers. Learn more about [Desktop Extensions](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/desktop-extensions).

## üí¨ Usage Examples & Business Applications

### üéß Customer Support & Operations
**Business Problem**: Support teams need to quickly investigate customer issues and transfer failures.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"Find all failed transfers for customer john.doe@company.com and explain why they failed"*
- *"Show me customer details for customer ID {id}"*
- *"List transfers for customer {id} in the last month"*

### üìä Financial Reconciliation & Reporting  
**Business Problem**: Finance teams need automated reconciliation and reporting.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"Calculate total transfer volume for Q1 2024 and compare to Q4 2023"*
- *"Show me all pending transfers over $10,000"*
- *"What's the current balance of my Dwolla Balance funding source?"*

### ‚öñÔ∏è Compliance & Risk Management

**Problem**: Compliance teams need to monitor suspicious activity, verify customer information, and ensure regulatory compliance.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"List all customers missing required beneficial ownership information"*
- *"Find transfers over $50,000 in the last 30 days for regulatory reporting"*
- *"Which customers need additional identity documents to maintain compliance?"*
- *"Identify customers with multiple failed transfer attempts this month"*

### üìà Business Intelligence & Analytics

**Problem**: Business teams need insights into payment patterns, customer behavior, and platform performance.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"What's the average transfer amount by customer segment and how has it changed?"*
- *"How many new verified customers were added this quarter vs last quarter?"*
- *"Which funding source types have the highest failure rates and why?"*
- *"Show me customers with increasing transfer volumes who might need premium features"*

### üë©‚Äçüíª Developer Tools & Integration Support

**Problem**: Development teams need to debug integrations, test scenarios, and understand API behavior.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"Show me the exact webhook events and timeline for transfer {id}"*
- *"What are the most common transfer failure reasons this week and their causes?"*
- *"Find examples of customers using each funding source type for testing"*
- *"Analyze the verification process for business customers who got stuck"*

### üö® Automated Monitoring & Alerting

**Problem**: Operations teams need proactive monitoring of system health and business metrics.

**Solutions with AI**:
- *"Has our daily failed transfer rate exceeded 5% and what's causing the failures?"*
- *"Show me any unusual spikes in transfer volumes or patterns today"*
- *"Which customers have been stuck in verification states for over 30 days?"*
- *"Are there any funding sources experiencing higher than normal failure rates?"*

### üí° Real-World Workflow Example

**Scenario**: Support receives an escalation about failed payments

**Traditional Process** (45+ minutes):
1. Log into multiple dashboards
2. Look up customers across different systems  
3. Check transfer history manually
4. Research failure codes in documentation
5. Escalate to engineering for analysis

**With Dwolla MCP** (5 minutes):
```
User: "We're seeing more transfer failures lately. Can you investigate?"

AI: "I'll analyze recent transfer failures for you."
‚Üí Pulls transfer data with failed status
‚Üí Groups by failure reasons
‚Üí Identifies top failure patterns
‚Üí Suggests specific customers to investigate
‚Üí Recommends remediation steps

Result: "I found a 15% increase in 'insufficient funds' failures, 
primarily from 3 specific customers. Here are the details and 
recommended actions..."
```

**Result**: Issue identified and resolved in 5 minutes instead of 45+ minutes, with complete context for the support agent.
